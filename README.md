# Direct Call Widget
An Android widget that makes it easier for people with vision problems to call their contacts.

# Why is it useful?
Direct Call Widget is an Android app intended to let users call their favorite contacts by clicking their pictures on the home screen. This is particuparly useful for people with vision issues or who cannot read (though they will need help for setting up the widgets).

The widgets may be scaled up or down, depending on the user's needs.

Here is what the app looks like:

# Is it profitable?
No, it is not at all, and it is not aimed to be. It is available for free on Google Play for anyone who may need it. Also it has no ads, so it will never pay my rent -hopefully it will make somebody's life a bit easier, though.

# I find this useful. May I contribute?
Certainly! I will be more than happy to get some help here. There are always things to improve or bugs to fix. Either you come up with something that needs to be enhanced or you want to solve any of the open issues, I will be very grateful for your contribution(s).
